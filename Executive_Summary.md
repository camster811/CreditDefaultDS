# Executive Summary: Credit Card Default Prediction

## Overview

This analysis explores methods to predict credit card defaults using machine learning techniques. The study uses the "Default of Credit Card Clients" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, and payment history of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

## Key Findings

1. **Class Imbalance**: The dataset is imbalanced, with only 22.1% of clients defaulting on their payments. This imbalance necessitated the use of specialized sampling techniques and evaluation metrics.

2. **Predictive Features**: Payment history variables (PAY_1 to PAY_6) were identified as the most important predictors of default risk. This suggests that recent payment behavior is a strong indicator of future default probability.

3. **Model Performance**: Random Forest with Raw data achieved the best overall performance with an F1-score of 0.458708, followed by Random Forest with PCA + K-Means sampling (F1-score: 0.416146). This suggests that ensemble methods can effectively predict credit card defaults, even without extensive preprocessing.

4. **Preprocessing Impact**: 
   - Different preprocessing techniques had varying effects on model performance:
   - For Logistic Regression, sampling techniques significantly improved performance, with PCA + K-Means sampling achieving the highest F1-score (0.414623).
   - For Random Forest, Raw data performed best, suggesting this model can effectively handle the original feature space without dimensionality reduction.
   - Sampling techniques generally improved recall at the expense of precision, which may be desirable in default prediction where missing a potential defaulter is more costly than falsely flagging a non-defaulter.

5. **Demographic Insights**:
   - Defaulters tend to have lower credit limits compared to non-defaulters.
   - Younger clients appear slightly more likely to default than older clients.
   - There is a strong relationship between repayment status and default probability, with clients having delayed payments being more likely to default.

## Methodology

The analysis employed a comprehensive methodology:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, engineered features, normalized variables, and applied dimensionality reduction.

2. **Handling Class Imbalance**: Applied K-Means sampling and KMeansSMOTE to address the imbalance between defaulters and non-defaulters.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Compared four different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest) using various evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC).

4. **Preprocessing Approaches**: Evaluated each model using four different preprocessing approaches (Raw data, PCA, PCA + K-Means sampling, PCA + KMeansSMOTE).

## Practical Implications

For financial institutions, implementing such models could improve risk management by identifying potential defaulters early, allowing for proactive interventions such as:

1. Payment reminders for high-risk customers
2. Restructuring options for customers showing early signs of payment difficulty
3. Credit limit adjustments based on predicted default risk
4. Targeted financial education for customer segments with higher default probabilities

## Limitations and Future Work

1. **Data Limitations**: The dataset is from Taiwan in 2005, which may limit the generalizability of findings to other regions or time periods.

2. **Model Complexity vs. Interpretability**: While more complex models like Random Forest performed better, they are less interpretable than simpler models like Logistic Regression, which may be a consideration for deployment in financial institutions where model transparency is important.

3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Models with high accuracy often had low recall (e.g., Random Forest with Raw data: 0.813133 accuracy but only 0.354936 recall), meaning they missed many actual defaulters. Conversely, models with high recall often had low accuracy (e.g., SVM with PCA + KMeansSMOTE: 0.226051 accuracy but 0.999394 recall), meaning they flagged many non-defaulters as defaulters.

4. **Future Directions**: Future work could explore more advanced feature engineering techniques, ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple models, or deep learning approaches that might capture more complex patterns in the data. Additionally, incorporating domain knowledge and business-specific cost functions could further improve the practical utility of these models.
