# Instructions for Finalizing the Credit Default Report

## Overview

This document provides instructions for finalizing the Credit Card Default Prediction report. The following files have been created:

1. `Credit_Default_Report.md` - The main report content in Markdown format
2. `Figures_to_Include.md` - A list of figures to extract from the notebook and include in the report
3. `Executive_Summary.md` - A summary of key findings and insights

## Steps to Finalize the Report

### 1. Extract Figures from the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `default_report.ipynb`
2. Run all cells to generate the visualizations
3. For each figure listed in `Figures_to_Include.md`:
   - Locate the figure in the notebook
   - Save the figure as an image file (PNG or JPG)
   - Name the file according to its content (e.g., `class_distribution.png`, `correlation_matrix.png`)

### 2. Insert Figures into the Report

1. Open `Credit_Default_Report.md`
2. Replace each `[INCLUDE FIGURE: Figure Name]` placeholder with the appropriate Markdown image syntax:
   ```markdown
   ![Figure Name](path/to/figure.png)
   ```
3. Ensure all figures are properly referenced in the text

### 3. Convert Markdown to PDF

#### Option 1: Using Pandoc

If you have [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) installed:

```bash
pandoc Credit_Default_Report.md -o Credit_Default_Report.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:"margin=1in" --toc
```

#### Option 2: Using a Markdown Editor

1. Open `Credit_Default_Report.md` in a Markdown editor that supports PDF export (e.g., Typora, Visual Studio Code with extensions)
2. Export the document as PDF

#### Option 3: Using Online Converters

1. Use an online Markdown to PDF converter (e.g., [MD2PDF](https://md2pdf.netlify.app/), [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/))
2. Upload the Markdown file and download the PDF

### 4. Final Review

1. Review the PDF for formatting issues
2. Ensure all figures are properly displayed
3. Check that all sections match the template requirements
4. Verify that all references are properly formatted

### 5. Incorporate Executive Summary

The `Executive_Summary.md` file contains a concise summary of the analysis. You can:

1. Include it as a separate section at the beginning of the report
2. Use it as a standalone document to accompany the main report
3. Extract key points to enhance the introduction and conclusion sections

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consistency**: Ensure consistent formatting throughout the document (headings, figure captions, etc.)
2. **Figure Quality**: Make sure all figures are high resolution and properly labeled
3. **Citations**: Double-check that all external sources are properly cited
4. **Proofreading**: Perform a final proofreading for grammar, spelling, and clarity

## Template Compliance

The report has been structured to follow the provided template. If you need to make adjustments to better align with specific requirements:

1. Compare the current structure with the template
2. Add or modify sections as needed
3. Ensure all required components are included

## Final Submission

When submitting the final report:

1. Include the PDF report
2. Attach the Jupyter notebook
3. Include any additional files required by your instructor
